To make sense of a software project is a daunting task. A lot of times one does not really know how the final product should look, and even less how the code should look. There are a million ways to design a solution and a million libraries still that can help you implement this solution. This is a short tutorial on how to break down a complex project into simpler tasks.

One way to handle a project is to follow the [waterfall](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_waterfall_model.htm) model. The waterfall model is quite simple in it's concepts. We set up requirements, we design the product, we code it, we deploy it and finally we maintain the final product. This method is reasonable if we know exactly what kind of product we want. But it relies on that the requirements and the design are stable. If we learn something new about the problem that we try to solve in the coding phase. We risk having to go back and redo the design, and as a consequence, redo a lot of work on the coding phase.

Since the whole point of working on side projects with friends is to explore new domains and technology the waterfall approach will work poorly. More often than not we will be in a state where we don't understand the problem we try to solve, or even how we want the final product to look. One solution to this problem is to work [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)
