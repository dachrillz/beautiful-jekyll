Recently I have been very interested in the basic building blocks in both computer science and mathematics. Most of the time in school is spent on higher level matters, such as how to solve practical problems. For example I have taken several courses where different methods to solve tricky integrals were discussed, or how to find the eigenvalues of certain matrices using numerical methods. This is reasonable, since it is in the end, more useful. However when studying computer science it is implied that one has to learn more about the fundamentals. Even though the language of choice for my computer engineering school is Java, (But they seem to flirt with the idea to switch over to Scala, which is cool) they still offer several courses were things are written in C. Because they want their students to better understand how a computer works.

This never happened in my mathematical education which is a pity. Therefore i decided to write a litte on some foundational mathematics, as I hope it depens my understanding of math in general.

With that said, which place is better to start with than the natural numbers?
