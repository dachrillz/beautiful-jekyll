subtitle: Who I am and why I bother with this...
---

My name is Christoffer. I am currently studying Computer Engineering in Sweden. Parallell to my studies in computer science I also studied mathematics which culminated in a Bachelor's Degree about Machine Learning and Artificial Neural Networks last year! (Have a look at the thesis me and my friend wrote!)

I started this blog partly because it is fun to write. But also in order to be able to communicate concepts that I find important to some of my friends that I want to do smaller projects with. Also, this is hopefully a way to show that I just don't learn because my school told me to, but I learn because I actually enjoy it! :)

With that said, take what is written here with a large grain of salt. Although enthusiastic, a lot of the things that I want to write about are things that I am in the process of learning about. If you find anything that grinds your gears - please let me know!
