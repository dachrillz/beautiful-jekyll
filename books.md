## Books finished this year:
    1. Knowledge and Power - George Gilder
    2. The Swerve - Stephen Greenblat
    3. SPQR - Mary Beard
    4. Mastering Ethereum - Andreas Antonopoulos & Dr. Gaving Wood:
    5. Die Therapie - Sebastian Fitzek

### Short reviews on thoughtwhile books:

##### Knowledge and Power - George Gilder:
Gilder's books are hard to summarize as they are very dense in information. In short - Gilder argues that capitalism is an information system. True wealth in this system is the accumulation of knowledge. The concept of entropy (that is the amount of surprise that a message containts) can also be applied to economics. That is, the entrepeneur and inventor in capitalism contributes with entropy as he creates information that is new to the world. This in turn increases the overall knowledge of the world, and is thus making us wealthier. This is a very worthwhile book, and I hope that I get a chance to study more Information Theory in the future in order to really understand Gilder's arguments.
##### The Swerve - Stephen Greenblatt:
A short feel good book about the people in the early renaissance that re-discovered many of the long lost classical texts. In particular this book emphasized the rediscovery of "De rerum Natura". A book which had the audacity to try to explain how the Universe actually works. Even though the classical book is non sensical by today's standards, it represents a shift away from the sole focus on the afterlife and pure reliance on faith. It instead tempts the reader to try to make sense of the natural world.
##### Mastering Ethereum - Andreas Antonopoulos & Dr. Gaving Wood:
I read Antonopoulos book "Mastering Bitcoin" last year in order to fully understand how Bitcoin works. I would say that Mastering Bitcoin gives you a good understanding of Bitcoin, and I was hoping that Mastering Ethereum would give the same deep understanding. Sadly however, the book was more focues on Smart Contract Development and not so much on the Ethereum Network itself. It makes more sense, since most people will be smart contract developers and not Ethereum developers. But I would really like a book that explains a smart contract platform like Ethereum in depth. However for people that want to learn about smart contract devlopment, this book will be a perfect match.
