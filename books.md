### Short reviews on thoughtwhile books

#### Knowledge and Power - George Gilder
Gilder's books are hard to summarize as they are very dense in information. In short - Gilder argues that capitalism is an information system. True wealth in this system is the accumulation of knowledge. The concept of entropy (that is the amount of surprise that a message containts) can also be applied to economics. That is, the entrepeneur and inventor in capitalism contributes with entropy as he creates information that is new to the world. This in turn increases the overall knowledge of the world, and is thus making us wealthier. This is a very worthwhile book, and I hope that I get a chance to study more Information Theory in the future in order to really understand Gilder's arguments.
#### The Swerve - Stephen Greenblatt
A short feel good book about the people in the early renaissance that re-discovered many of the long lost classical texts. In particular this book emphasized the rediscovery of "De rerum Natura". A book which had the audacity to try to explain how the Universe actually works. Even though the classical book is non sensical by today's standards, it represents a shift away from the sole focus on the afterlife and pure reliance on faith. It instead tempts the reader to try to make sense of the natural world.
#### Mastering Ethereum - Andreas Antonopoulos & Dr. Gaving Wood
I read Antonopoulos book "Mastering Bitcoin" last year in order to fully understand how Bitcoin works. I would say that Mastering Bitcoin gives you a good understanding of Bitcoin, and I was hoping that Mastering Ethereum would give the same deep understanding. Sadly however, the book was more focues on Smart Contract Development and not so much on the Ethereum Network itself. It makes more sense, since most people will be smart contract developers and not Ethereum developers. But I would really like a book that explains a smart contract platform like Ethereum in depth. However for people that want to learn about smart contract devlopment, this book will be a perfect match.
#### On Grand Strategy - John Lewis Gaddis
This is hands down one of the best books I have read. The author goes through some selected historical examples and discusses the grand strategy behind these important moments. He separates the master strategicians from the not so good strategicians. Strategy is a very abstract concept, and even though you will likely never command an army - a good sense of strategy is incredibly helpful for whatever one wants do to. One phrase that stuck with me was "Unlimited aspirations, but limited capabilites", it is normal that we want to do more than we are capable of doing. Therefore one should always focus a significant amount of effort on increasing ones resources and abilities. A common mistake for both private persons, enterprises and nations is to take a too large of a bite, before they are ready to do so!
#### Zero to One - Peter Thiel
I'm a huge fan of Peter Thiel and found his book very informative. It is however more relevant for people that want to start a business, which I am personally far from doing. An interesting book nonetheless however.
#### Factfulness - Hans Rosling
This book was interesting and informative. It is a worthwhile book, where he argues that the world in general is better of than one usually thinks. It feels like a book that everyone should read today basically, as it is part of the mainstream narrative. However, even though the book says that the world in general is better of than we usually think, there is still cause for concern for the West. I have seen people cite this book saying that "Everything will be fine, and any cause for concern that you have is invalid". However I would just like to add that as the rest of the world becomes more competetive, the more competetive the West has to be to keep up. If we are not, we risk being the ones falling behind, which is a scary prospect.
